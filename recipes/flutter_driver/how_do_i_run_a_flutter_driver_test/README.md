# Question

How do I run a [flutter driver](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_driver/flutter_driver-library.html) test?

# Answer

## 1) Create a flutter application.

```sh
flutter create ftc
cd ftc
```

## 2) Add [flutter_driver](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_driver/flutter_driver-library.html) and [test](https://pub.dev/packages/test) to your `pubspec.yaml` file.

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_driver:
    sdk: flutter
  test: any
```

Then get the dependencies by running:

```sh
flutter packages get
```

## 3) Replace the `lib/main.dart` file

Replace the `lib/main.dart` file with the following:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: Center(
          child: Text("Hello world"),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## 4) Create a `test_driver` directory.

```sh
mkdir test_driver
cd test_driver
```

## 5) Add an `example.dart` file.

Create a `test_driver/example.dart` file, and add the following to it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_driver/driver_extension.dart';
import 'package:ftc/main.dart' as app;

void main() {
  // Add the following to leverage flutter_driver
  enableFlutterDriverExtension();

  app.main();
}
```

[Reference](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/testing/integration/introduction#4-instrument-the-app)

## 6) Add an `example_test.dart` file.

Create a `test_driver/example_test.dart` file, and add the following to it:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_driver/flutter_driver.dart';
import 'package:test/test.dart';

void main() {
  FlutterDriver driver;

  setUpAll(() async {
    driver = await FlutterDriver.connect();
  });

  tearDownAll(() async {
    if (driver != null) {
      await driver.close();
    }
  });

  test("'Hello world' text exists", () async {
    SerializableFinder helloWorldTextFinder = find.text("Hello world");

    await driver.waitFor(helloWorldTextFinder);
  });
}
```

## 7) Run the flutter driver tests

```sh
flutter driver -t test_driver/example.dart
```

# Run tests from example code in cookbook itself

If you have cloned [flutter_test_cookbook](https://github.com/gadfly361/flutter_test_cookbook/tree/master) and simply want to run the tests from this recipe, then:

```sh
flutter create .
flutter packages get
flutter driver -t test_driver/example.dart
```

# Outputs when recipe was made / updated
